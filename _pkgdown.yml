  title: An R package Simple and Scalable Statistical Modelling
  description: >
    Write statistical models in R and fit them by MCMC and optimisation on CPUs
    and GPUs, using Google TensorFlow. greta lets you write your own model
    like in BUGS, JAGS and Stan, except that you write models right in R, it
    scales well to massive datasets, and it's easy to extend and build on. See
    the website for more information, including tutorials, examples, package
    documentation, and the greta forum.
